- Highest revenue is generated by 'Best Customers' segment, customers from this segment also buy with the highest frequency and recency scores, making them highly engaged and profitable.  

- 'Loyal Customers' and 'Potential Loyalists' are falling behind, but they still show relatively strong results 

- Customers segments 'At Risk' and 'Need Attention' contribute significantly to revenue, we have to take a deeper look and think about ways to re-engage

- 'Big Spenders' returns high monetary value, yet they purchase infrequenctly. While being valuable, they may require a different marketing approach
  
- 'About to Sleep' and 'Lost Customers' brings relatively low revenue, although these categories might not be our target audience, thus we should evaluate if further investing in those are necessary

-  'Cant Lose Them' segment stands out due to high revenue and decent frequency score. It is crucial to find ways to re-engage them and test assumptions about churn

### Detailed RFM analysis:

<img width="1200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab64c048-46c9-4fb1-aaee-cc104dac06a9" />

- Highest numbers of customers are in 'About to Sleep' (15%) segment and together with 'Lost Customers' (10%) segment it contributes to 25% of total customers. Despite their size, their average revenue is low. We should evaluate whether it would be beneficial to pay attention to those segments.

- 'Best Customers' (10%), 'Loyal Customers' (11%) and 'Potential Loyalists' (11%) bring the highest revenue and together combined makes 32% of total customers. We should think about upselling opportunities and offer them rewards for being our top customers.

- 'Big Spenders' (1%) does not buy too often and even though average revenue is high, they provide lower total revenue for whole overlooked period. While their behavior may not shift significantly, we could explore strategies to increase their average basket size or frequency through exclusive promotions.

- 'New Customers' (9%) and 'Promising Customers' (9%) could compensate lost customers and those who are about to sleep, we should create brand awareness and provide on-boarding support.

- 'At Risk' (9%), 'Cant Lose Them' (3%) and 'Need Attention' (10%) together contributes to 22% of total customers, besides, customers of this category generate significant monetary value and it is very important to keep an eye on them. We have to find ways to re-engage with them by testing strategies and various assumptions that could potentially be beneficial.

## Recommendations:

- Identify reasons why 'About to Sleep' and 'Lost Customers' segments are relatively high by number of customers.
- I assume that 'Best Customers', 'Loyal Customers' and 'Potential Loyalists' have a higher likelihood to respond positively to upsell offers and loyalty incentives. We should test the impact of loyalty programs and higher-value product recommendations on their AOV and purchase frequency

- Engage with 'Big Spenders', we should aim to increase the frequency of buying or increasing average ordering value. We should A/B test personalized offers to validate opportunities to increase frequency or basket size

- Provide high quality on-boarding support and create brand awareness for New and Promising customers

- Give attention to 'At Risk', 'Cant Lose Them' and 'Need Attention' segments, send them limited time offers, renewal discounts, personalized emails to reconnect and reactivate

## Main task

Prepare Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis, provide weekly cohort analysis to analyze customer spending over 12 weeks.

## Insights

### Weekly Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by Cohorts (USD)

<img width="996" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d868b0c-69f2-4388-9c93-f8e7434709d2" />

- Highest average revenue per user is on the initial start week which indicates strong early monetization

- There is a significant decline after a few weeks, which indicates a decline in user engagement or monetization opportunities

- Users who registered in November generate more revenue not only in their first week but also consistently across subsequent weeks, compared to users who joined in December. This could reflect stronger marketing quality, better onboarding, or seasonal factors affecting user intent.

- The highest weekly average revenue per user is on November 22 week, lowest seems to be in the first and the last weeks of January. It indicates that there could be some product/marketing issue or seasonality effect

### Cumulative ARPU by Cohorts (USD)

<img width="994" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa194a6a-e66e-4602-b49e-384a95971b8d" />

- If customer acquisition costs are 2 USD, we can see an actual payback in November within the first 4 weeks

- However, if we look at December and January, none of those customers seem to reach those numbers and overall growth across weeks is low

- Users in November show consistent and high cumulative AOV over time

- December and January customers drop significantly over time, it indicates seasonal/post-holiday changes or possible changes in product pricing or engagement

- Most of user value that is generated comes within the first 3-4 weeks, we should think about re-engaging users after those weeks 

- Second week of November seems to return excellent results compared to other months, it may indicate holiday traffic, or impact of ads or referral campaigns

### Cumulative ARPU Prediction by Cohorts (USD)

- While the data is still partially predictive, the consistently weak early performance suggests a low likelihood of strong lifetime value, raising concerns about the quality and intent of users acquired during this period.

- November cohorts show eventual payback by weeks 3-5. However, those numbers are not ideal and only slightly exceeds CAC, suggesting limited long-term profitability. 

- December and January cohorts underperform and predictions show that breakeven is not approached at all. This could be related to decline in user quality due to seasonality or product related reasons. 

- Weaker revenue growth patterns indicate a potentional problem and this trend shows that acquisition and onboarding flows should be re-evaluated. Also, either CAC should be reduced or monetization strategy should be improved to maintain sustainability

- As we have average LTV 1.471, we are acquiring users at a loss on average - current user acquisition is not sustainable in the long term

## Recommendations 

- Enhance onboarding, test early stage upselling offers and assess churn reasons after few weeks of being our customers

- Analyze campaign data from November to identify what drove higher revenue and retention. Determine whether results were due to superior execution or seasonal trends, and use those insights to refine future campaigns.

- Test lifecycle re-engagement campaigns starting after a few weeks of using our products

- With current LTVs below CAC, there is a need to either lower acquisition costs or improve monetization flows

- Forecast seasonal patterns to adjust campaigns budget and messaging accordingly
